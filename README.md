# Projects with Python
This repo presents some projects completed during my learning journey over the python programming language, mainly exploring the amazing [MOOCs by Helsinki University](https://www.mooc.fi/en/#courses). They go from beginner all the way to advanced programming and data analysis with Python, which reflect pretty well my current level at this language.
